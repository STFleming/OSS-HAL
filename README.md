# Swansea OPS-SAT base FPGA image

This repository contains a base FPGA image that is compatible with the Swansea FlatSat. It is used for developing custom hardware projects that can fly on-board OPS-SAT. 

## ToDo

* open the base project in a tcl script
* from the tcl script compile and build the project and generate the bitstream
* add a make file
* allow for the easy creation of bus-based IP cores and automate their integration into the system via tcl
